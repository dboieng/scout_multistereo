- Found out that Jetson Orin Nano is Release 36 Version 4.4 which runs ROS ISSAC 3.2 and not the most recent ROS ISSAC 4.1
- I Asked on the NIVIDA forums [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/does-ros-issac-4-1-0-work-on-the-jetson-orin-nano/359612) if the Jetson Orin Nano will work on ROS ISSAC 4.1 and if ISSAC ROS 3.2 will have continued support.

## Stereo Log 0.5.02.26
- Based on the forum response I will go through the process of install ROS ISSAC 3.2
- I am a  bit annoyed they have not answered the question about continued surpport
